      <h3>Culture</h3>

      <p>We strive to build an interdisciplinary team working in the area of <strong>understanding humans</strong>.  I called my area of research <b>Human AI Interaction</b>. Our core values are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Experimental</strong>: We value scientific rigor, focusing on researching under strong scientific
          grounds and conducting sound experiments that provide definitive and repeatable findings.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Computational</strong>: Our scientific nature is to use algorithms, mathematical models, strong
          theoretical background, and strong coding skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lab Entry</h3>

      <p>We welcomed students from all disciplines but those with a huge passion for research.</p>

      <h3>Current Projects</h3>

      {{/*  <p style="line-height:1.38; margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"><strong>Fundamental Research (suitable for Ph.D. students or Master students who want to go Ph.D.)</strong></p>  */}}
      <p>Understanding humans</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Understanding humans through EEG</strong>: How does EEG profile looks like when humans are stressed?  engaged?  mindful? etc.  Then can we create an intervention system to improve these properties?</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding humans through language</strong>: How can we model beliefs, emotion, cognition, behaviors, cultural/emotional/cognitive biases, etc. in language? </li>
        <li><strong>Understanding humans through voice</strong>: Can we detect depression, humours, or risk profiles from a person's voice?  What should we ask him/her to speak to detect that?  How long should that voice be?  Does it work for only certain languages? Does it get better results if we combine with facial features?</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding humans through learning paradigms</strong>: Can we model human through the lens of multimodal or reinforcement learning? </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Brain Imaging</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>AI-augmented brain diagnosis</strong>: How to develop a system to help radiologists in making better decisions through effective Human AI interaction? How to build explaninability and trust? How reasoning can be done and used to improve decision makings?  How the UI design and workflow process should be like?  Does VQA helps?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Raman spectroscopy</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Raman Spectroscopy</strong>: How to measure blood glucose non-invasively using Raman spectroscopy?  Can we put them into a portable low-cost machine and deploy them into households?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Applications</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>EEG BCI Speller</strong>: How to develop an effective and user-friendly BCI speller for locked-in patients using EEG?</li>
        <li><strong>AI Interviewer and Onboarding</strong>: How AI can be used to help interview and screen applicants, as well as providing onboarding?  How does a complete HR x AI solution will look like?</li>
        <li><strong>AI Research Writer</strong>: How AI can be used to help researchers write better papers, but without influencing their creativity?</li>
        <li><strong>Driver Activity Recognition</strong>: How AI can be used to detect driver activity while driving?</li>
        <li><strong>Thai government documents</strong>: Writing tenders to send to Thai government is a very time-consuming due to the format and language style.  Can we reimagine a better way by using AI to help?</li>
        <li><strong>Psychometric analysis</strong>: Can we perform psychometric analysis using face analysis + voice analysis + digital footprints for risk assessment of a person?</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation in sales chatbot</strong>: How to best personalize product recommendation in insurance/sales settings?</li>
        <li><strong>Car damage prediction system</strong>: How to design and develop a system that could accurately and reliably predict car damage?</li>
        <li><strong>Chatbot for emotional support</strong>: Can we incorporate CBT/DBT/ACT to chatbot to provide emotional support to people suffering from stress or depression?</li>
        <li><strong>Thai Sign2Text</strong>: How to develop a user-friendly mobile-based Sign2Text and Text2Sign application to support communication between deaf people and the society?</li>
      </ol>
