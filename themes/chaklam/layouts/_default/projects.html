      <h3>Culture</h3>

      <p>We strive to build an interdisciplinary team working at the area of <strong>natural language processing,
          medical AI </strong>and<strong> brain computer interfaces</strong>. Our core values are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Experimental</strong>: We value scientific rigor, focusing on researching under strong scientific
          grounds and conducting sound experiments that provide definitive and repeatable findings.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Computational</strong>: Our scientific nature is to use algorithms, mathematical models, strong
          theoretical background, and strong coding skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lab Entry</h3>

      <p>We welcomed students from all disciplines but those with a huge passion for publishing to top-tier
        conferences/journalsand/or making startup-relatedproduct. Make sure you read our graduation criteria here first:
        <a href="/researchguide">research guide</a>. Each year, we TRY not to take more than
        10 students.
      </p>

      <h3>Internship</h3>

      <p>We welcomed internship students to work on some of the applications/products (not Theory) we are working at.
        There is no criteria for finishing internship - the primary function is to give you some real job and let you
        get it done. Please contact me if you are interested.</p>

      <h3>Current Projects</h3>

      <p>We recommend everyone joining our lab to pursue these continuing projects; we TRY NOT to take any students new
        topics.</p>

      <p style="line-height:1.38; margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"><strong>Theory</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Foundational models for Thai language</strong>: develop embedding, instruct,
          speech-text, image-text, style transfer, and emotion-speech models for Thai language, using pruning,
          distillation, grafting, quantization, prefix-tuning for efficient models.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarization + knowledge transfer</strong>: apply knowledge transfer such as
          shared prefix tuning, multi-task training, self-distillation to summarization tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarization</strong> + <strong>masking</strong>: apply selective masking
          techniques for better summarization.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarization + progressive pruning and distillation</strong> - apply progressive pruning and
          distillation for better summarization models.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarization + contrastive learning</strong> - apply contrastive
          learning for better summarization models.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarization + reinforcement learning</strong>: apply RL for better summarization models.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarization + mixture of experts</strong>: apply mixture of experts for better summarization
          models.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Visual QA</strong>: design models for better medical visual QA.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Application</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Glucose monitoring</strong>:contributes to the use of Raman spectroscopy and
          the development of Raman portables to monitor blood glucose in real-time.</li>
        <li><strong>BCI speller</strong>:contributes to the development of BCI speller using EEG
          paradigms such as P300, SSVEP, Hybrid P300-SSVEP and motor imagery for locked-in patients.</li>
        <li><strong>Scholarly</strong>: contributes to the development of product we called "Scholarly" which help
          researchers to write papers using style transfer and generative models. Style paraphrasing, grammar checkers,
          co-writers are among the key modules. Support English and Thai language.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-based Report Generation</strong>: contributes to the development of AI-powered report generation system,
          saving time and enhancing consistency.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Medical AI</strong>: contributes to the development of automatic annotation,
          segmentation, search and reporting for fMRI/MRI/CT scanimages. Support both textual and menu
          commands input.</li>
        <li><strong>ChatData</strong>: contributes to the development of a platform we called
          ChatData that can be the core platform to create other products such as legalGPT, medicalGPT, insuranceGPT,
          financeGPT, etc. There will many components: (1) instruction (parameter efficient) tuning with dialogue
          datasets, (2) reinforcement learning, (3) retrieval augmentation, (4) quantization for efficiency, (5) support
          images using OCR and image-text models, (6) support speech-text models for voice-based chats like call centers, (7) support English and Thai, (7) agents - using tools of
          the internet.</li>
      </ol>
