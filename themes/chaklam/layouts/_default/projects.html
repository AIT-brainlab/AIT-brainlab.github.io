      <h3>Culture</h3>

      <p>We strive to build an interdisciplinary team working in the area of <strong>understanding humans</strong> and <strong>improving overall human's wellbeing</strong>.  I called my area of research <b>Human AI Interaction</b>.  It's an interdisciplinary area intersecting technology and humans. Our core values are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Experimental</strong>: We value scientific rigor, focusing on researching under strong scientific
          grounds and conducting sound experiments that provide definitive and repeatable findings.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Computational</strong>: Our scientific nature is to use algorithms, mathematical models, strong
          theoretical background, and strong coding skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lab Entry</h3>

      <p>We welcomed students from all disciplines but those with a huge passion for research.</p>

      <h3>Current Projects</h3>

      {{/*  <p style="line-height:1.38; margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"><strong>Fundamental Research (suitable for Ph.D. students or Master students who want to go Ph.D.)</strong></p>  */}}
      <p>Understanding humans</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Understanding humans through EEG</strong>: How does EEG profile looks like when humans are stressed?  engaged?  mindful? etc.  Then can we create an intervention system to improve these properties?</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding humans through language</strong>: How can we model beliefs, emotion, cognition, behaviors, cultural/emotional/cognitive biases, etc. in language? </li>
        <li><strong>Understanding humans through voice and face</strong>: Can we detect depression, confidence, humours, or risk profiles from a person's voice?  What should we ask him/her to speak to detect that?  How long should that voice be?  Does it work for only certain languages? Does it get better results if we combine with facial features?</li>
        {{/*  <li><strong>Understanding humans through video games + AI</strong>: Can we better understand human through human-game AI interaction to understand their cognitions, emotions, behaviors, social mechanisms? </li>  */}}
      </ol>

      <p>Improving humans' well-being and health</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>AI for Brain (CT / MRI)</strong>: How to develop an AI system for stroke diagnosis or  hemorrhage?  What are some brain analysis tasks that doctors cannot do very well but AI can?  How to incorporate AI to the current workflow? How to build explaninability and trust? How reasoning can be done and used to improve decision makings?  Can we incorporate VQA?  How does traditional computer vision techniques compared with modern techniques like semi-supervised or self-supervised learning?  Can we use diffusion or generative AI to create infinite medical images?</li>
        <li><strong>Raman Spectroscopy</strong>: How to measure blood glucose non-invasively using Raman spectroscopy?  Can we put them into a portable low-cost machine and deploy them into households?</li>
        <li><strong>EEG BCI Speller</strong>: How to develop an effective and user-friendly BCI speller for locked-in patients using EEG?</li>
        <li><strong>EEG for Meditation</strong>:  It's obvious that meditation has many health benefits. How to integrate EEG to help measure the progress of meditation, as well as a means to help enhance the quality of meditation, e.g., through neurofeedback?</li>
        <li><strong>Chatbot for emotional support</strong>: Can we incorporate CBT/DBT/ACT to chatbot to provide emotional support to people suffering from stress or depression?</li>
        <li><strong>Flood risk assessment</strong>:  Thailand has a lot of flood.  How to create a reliable risk assessment system, assessing risks of properties based on region, flood index, etc., as well as estimating damage?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Computer Vision</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Car damage prediction system</strong>: How to design and develop a system that could accurately and reliably predict car damage?</li>
        <li><strong>House damage prediction system</strong>: How to design and develop a system that could accurately and reliably predict house damage, after flood, which is very common in Thailand?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Thai Models</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Speech2Text / Text2Speech </strong>: Most Thai Speech2Text / Text2Speech still does not work quite well.  We need a better dataset, engineering, and training approaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice cloning</strong>: Thailand does not yet have a model for voice cloning.  Voice cloning would be useful for the purpose of education and tourism.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice analysis</strong>: Can we use something like wav2vec idea to analyze Thai voices, to extract human qualities like excitements, confidence, stress, burnout, etc.?</li>
        <li><strong>Face analysis</strong>: Can we analyze Asian / Asean faces, to extract emotions, gender, stress, confidence, liveness, etc., for the purpose of AI applications?</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional LLM</strong>: How to train a Thai LLM that knows how to properly write Thai text, with the AI being emotionally intelligence, culturally aware, and eloquent?</li>
        <li><strong>OCR</strong>:  Most Thai OCR still has problems with robustness in different conditions.   We need more dataset to train a versatile OCR model.</li>
        <li><strong>Chatbot for doctors</strong>: Since doctors are human who have limited capacity in reviewing papers or past cases, can chatbot provide doctors with relevant past diagnosis or research papers which AI is good at doing, similar to what Google AMIE?</li>
        <li><strong>Chatbot for lawyers</strong>: Can chatbot help lawyers retrieval relevant legal precedents, case laws, or regulations?  Can chatbot help draft legal documents or analyze and highlight critical issues, inconsistencies, or compliance risks?  Can chatbot provide lawyers with relevant case information, including past court rulings, opinions, etc.?  Can it also help train new lawyers?</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Tutor</strong>: How to develop a user-friendly personalized AI tutor to support tutoring for the poor and to reskill?</li>
      </ol>
