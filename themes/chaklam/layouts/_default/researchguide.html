      <p>Here is a very short, concise beginner guide for AIT Master students (applicable to Ph.D. students too).
      </p>

      <h3>Graduation criteria</h3>

      <p>To graduate from AIT Brain lab, Master students should either (1) develop a <strong>workable, deployed
          product </strong>(justification of 1-year effort) with formal user evaluation, or (2) publish in
        <strong>top-tier journals / conferences</strong>. Ph.D. students should publish <strong>3 top-tier
          journals / conferences</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Meeting protocols</h3>

      <p>For Master's, we will have weekly meetings.  For PhD's, it is monthly meeting.  In the meeting, you briefly talk about progress, bottlenecks or obstacles that require attention, and next steps.</p>

      <p>I personally do not prefer scheduling separate meetings as my schedule is very unpredictable and thus could hurt your planning.  Try to talk as much in the regular meetings.   But if really needed, check my free slots in chaklam@ait.asia and book accordingly.</p>

      <h3>Advices</h3>

      <p>Research can be very difficult.  Here are my distilled short advices. You should 
      <ol>
        <li>leverage your lab members to help you as much as possible</li>
        <li>try to come to lab and associate with your friends</li>
        <li>figure out what's the problem you want to solve by reading top-tier papers</li>
        <li>figure out creative, new solution and also consider the feasibility</li>
        <li>run a lot of experiments and analyses</li>
      </ol>

      </ul>

      <h3>More advices</h3>

      <p>It's well grounded that research is not only about intelligence but also of your attitude and mindset.  Here is what I think my successful students do, compared to less successful students.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong passion</strong>:  this is perhaps a very important factor separating the successful and the less ones.  Passion is not about career, money or for fun.  Passion is <b>something you truly believe in</b>.  If you really love the topic you are doing, the rest of the below factors come.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-discipline</strong>:  keeps you focus on tasks on hand and <b>constantly thinking about your work</b>. No single successful students do not have self-discipline because research is difficult.</li>
        <li><strong>Competence</strong>:  they execute the research in a well-planned systematic logical manner.  You can close the gap by talking with them, while also working 2x or 3x more than these people. Consistently copy how they work and adjust to your own style.  Before you work smart, you need to first work hard.</li>
        <li><strong>Listen</strong>:  they carefully listen to what the supervisor said, and try to catch the essence.  <b>Less successful usually skip the so-called obvious advices</b> and fail. Of course, your supervisor may not know everything and no one does, but it is your job to learn to communicate effectively your ideas and listen him/her carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive attitude</strong>:  they seldom blame anyone if they fail.  They keep going, know how to positively self-talk, and embrace and accepts struggles as learning process.  Under huge stress, their positive attitude carry them forward. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1. Timeline</h3>

      <p>Here is a simple figure explaining your one-year thesis journey. You have one year to complete your
        thesis; most students extend to one or two more semesters:</p>

      <h3>2. Selecting topics</h3>

      <p>First step to choose topics is to visit <a href="/projects">Projects</a>. I TRY NOT to work on any
        other topics outside of this list.</p>

      <p>Once you select the topic, a good exercise to do is to fill in the blanks of these questions, which will form
        the five paragraphs of your Introduction:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: The ability to differentiate person
                      in dialogue summarization is important. Past work mostly focuses on ________ (talk about
                      what people mostly do…)</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
        </li>
        <li><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>PROBLEM</strong>: However, the key limitation is
                      ___________________________(major gap in past
                      work)</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
        </li>
        <li><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>SOLUTION</strong>: This paper proposes
                      _____________________ (solution that directly fix the
                      gap)</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
        </li>
        <li><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>RESULTS</strong>: We found that ___________________
                      (results that confirm we fix the gap…)</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
        </li>
        <li><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>CONTRIBUTION</strong>: The results implied that
                      _________________ (generalizability of your work…)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Do your research!</h3>

      <p>Doing your research is a daunting task. I have provided a very short snippets of success you may want to try for both fundamental research and applied research.</p>

      <p><img class="img-fluid" alt="how to do research" src="/img/applicationway.png" width="750" /></p>


      <h3>4. Deliverables</h3>

      <p>Your main deliverables for your thesis are</p>

      <ol>
        <li>the public GitHub link of your code,</li>
        <li>final thesis report</li>
        <li>video demo (if you are applied research),</li>
        <li>final publication (if you are fundamental research)</li>
      </ol>
