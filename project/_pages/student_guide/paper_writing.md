This guide is written following the `Thesis report workshop` of Dr. Chaklam during 2022 August semester.

Here is the link to workshop `Overleaf` [link](https://www.overleaf.com/project/630430e80aea50797a5b4fbe).

## 1. Abstract

- You have to write it NOW!
- You look at the `Abstract` very regularly!
- Real writing starts at after 15 revisions.
- This is NOT about writing; is about planning, thinking, making sure you will not have any serious errors.
- You should finish this by end of August.

### Steps

1. Background
  : Very specific background; hint the problem.
2. Problem
  : Very very measurable problem; start with a signal word like "However", "Anyhow", or "Despite".
3. Solution
  : Use verb wisely; explore/investigate/develop/compare.
4. Key finding (2 - 3 sentences)
  : Summarize ONLY the key findings - it means interesting findings.
5. Contributions
  : Why this is important to be solved; what impact it can bring.

## 2. Literature Review/Related Work

- By mid-September; why: because we want to propose on October!.
- No general knowledge.
- Group them by subsection for readability.
- How many pages: if like thesis format in double lines - you need 4-5 pages or 15-30 citations.
- Purpose of `related work`:
  1. Find the gap.
  2. Find the gap in IV, DV, hypothesis, methodology.
  3. Find the gap, so readers CAN BELIEVE that what you do is NEW NEW NEW.
- This is NOT the purpose of `related work`:
  1. To give lecture/Explain basic stuff: Because EVERY reader is Chaklam, Matthew, ...
- IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE FIELD, do not be arrogant... There are many people smarter than you 100%.

### Steps

1. Choose the recent work.
2. Choose the "relatively" high citation. 
3. Try to avoid some conferences that look sketchy.

### Cite style

#### Command example
`\shortciteA{jalilpour2020novel} hellooooo` => `Jalilpour et al. (2020) hellooooo`

```bib
Jalilpour, S., Sardouie, S. H., & Mijani, A. (2020). A novel hybrid bci speller
based on rsvp and ssvep paradigm. Computer methods and programs in
biomedicine, 187, 105326.
```

#### Subject form
- if you have <= two authors, the format is 
  - `author1lastname and author2lastname (2020) proposed....`; 
  - don't do `[5] proposed this...`; 
  - don't do.  `Some people [5] do this...`;  
- if you have > two authors, the format is 
  - `author1lastname et al. (2020) proposed....`

#### Indirect form
- if you have <= two authors, the format is 
  - `... (author1lastname and author2lastname , 2020)` 
  - `... (author1lastname and author2lastname , 2020; next guy....)` 
  - sometimes they use number format: `... [4];` `... [5, 7, 99]`;
- if you have > two authors, the format is 
  - `... (author1lastname et al., 2020)`


## A1. Journal Impact Factor

Impact Factor:
- \> 1: high in AIT's standard
- \> 2: high
- \> 3: high in Chaky's standard

## A2. Conference Rank

This way, for ML, DL, HCI thesis, is better. Normally, when published, you have to go to conference.

For rank, we use `H-Index`
- For `AI`: [google-scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence)
- For `HCI`: [google-scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=de&vq=eng_humancomputerinteraction)
- For `Neuro`: [google-scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=med_neurology)
- For `NLP`: [google-scholar](https://scholar.google.co.th/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computationallinguistics)
