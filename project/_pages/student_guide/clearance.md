## 1. Typical Guideline 

### For `Thesis`

**Semester 3**
Step 0 (~1hr): Discuss the area of interest with Chaky and Ph.D. students -> Broad topic/title
1st step (~ 2w): Paper reading and Related Work writing.
2nd step (~2w): Topic confirmation with supervisor AND Ph.D. students -> Narrow and focus Topic/title
3rd step (~4w): Writing Introduction, Related Work, Methodology
4th step (~4w): Rewriting + Start coding proof of concept
5th step (~2w): Proposal presentation

**Semester 4**
6th step (~4w): Implementation
7th step (~2w): Writing the remaining section Result, Discussion, Conclusion
8th step (~1w): Proposal Progress
9th step (~4w): Publication + lots of rewriting
10th step (~2w): Final Defense

**Graduate Hooray~!!**

### For `Research`

The research starts in your final semester. You only have 4 months.
You should propose your research before the midterm.
Finish it and defend the third month.
Publish before final.

## 3. How to write 101
1. **Topic sentence / Thesis statement**: The introduction will consist of fives paragraph. The first one will be about the background. It should summarize why the chosen field is important.
2. **No bulls\*\*t**: Bulls\*\*t is "things the reader already know". We should avoid writing general knowledge. Try to shorten the sentence as much as possible.
3. **Facts; no emotion: **
    - Popular, famous, very, always should not be used
    - If it is commonly accepted knowledge then you don't need to cite
    - If the sentence is not a fact, use 'may/might'.
    - Evidence!!
4. **No ambiguity**: Each word should have only one meaning
    - "My performance is good" "My system outperforms the baseline" - these two sentences did not tell you in what way the system is good.
