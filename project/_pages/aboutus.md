## Origins and History

The idea of establishing a certain health and wellness initiative such as program or research centers was raised by DEAN SET, Prof. Dieter Trau during the SET Retreat on 15 December 2020 at Pinehurst Golf Club & Hotel. The potential of such initiative are made based on three important observations:

- **Lack of combined research efforts** or initiatives on health exists on AIT
- **Strong existing set of faculties** on health-related domains that can possibly collaborate together yielding impact on health research domains
- **Relevance of the COVID pandemic** raises the importance of health and wellness technologies	

Based on these observations, a workshop has been held among the team (see Section C: Research Centre Team) during the Retreat discussing the most feasible "first" step yielding some initial consensuses and decisions. These decisions are further discussed and solidified in a meeting held on 17 February 2021. The executive summaries of the meeting are as follows:

- Agreed that starting the initiative as a **research center** is the most viable option
- Agreed on the working title of the center as **"Health and Wellness Technologies"**
- Agreed on the need to draft a **proposal** discussing the general direction, activities of the center, revenue streams, etc. This present document is a response to the call.
- Agreed on the need to draft an **internal agreement** stating the recognition of incoming revenues under the members' department.  This present document contains such clauses in section F.2 and agreement in section G.
